Configure with bind
===================


If you use a local bind instance you can configure twistd dns with bind adding this stanza to named.conf. For now this requires to disable EDNS, which is not actuallyimplemented in docker_dns.


zone "docker" {
        type forward;
        forwarders {
                127.0.0.64;
        };
};


And binding your local docker_dns server on the following
loopback ip: 127.0.0.64
